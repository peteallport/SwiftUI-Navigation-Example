# SwiftUI Navigation Example
This is a SwiftUI Navigation Example Xcode project using ios 15/macOS 11. It uses only one `NavigationView()` and multiple `NavigationLink` without using `(value: P?)`. 

This project further illustrates the need to have a "dummy" top-level view so when initialized the MacOS navigation `toolbar()` items are displayed correctly and continue to do so for child views.
